\f0\fs48 \cf0 So I made JNWCollectionView. This whole app is composed of a single collection view with a custom layout. I made a demo app, then proceeded to spend an embarrassingly long time pouring over the Instruments time profiles for days, trying my hardest to squeeze every single frame I could out of it. This library still needs quite a bit more work, but I think it exemplifies all of my interests in a single library.}
